        <p>The first pizza dough I ever made. Perfect for fun pizza making sessions with friends.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>500g Bread flour</li>
            <li>16g kosher salt</li>
            <li>1g active dry yeast</li>
            <li>350 ml water</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium bowl, thoroughly blend the flour, active dry yeast, and salt. Add the water and, with a wooden spoon or your hands, mix thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a kitchen towel and allow it to rise at room temperature for 18 hours or until it has more than doubled. It will take longer in a chilly room and less time in a very warm one.</li>
            <li>Flour a work surface and scrape out the dough. Divide it into 4 equal parts and shape them. For each portion, start with the right side of the dough and pull it towards the center; then do the same with the left, then the top, then the bottom (the order doesn't actually matter; what you want is four folds). Shape each portion into a round and turn seam side down. Mold the dough into a neat circular mound. The mounds should not be sticky; if they are, dust with more flour.</li>
            <li>If you don't intend to use the dough right away, wrap the balls individually in plastic and refrigerate for up to 3 days. Return to room temperature by leaving them out on the counter, covered in a damp cloth, for 2 to 3 hours before needed.</li>
        </ol>
